### ðŸš§ **Description**

This project facilitates the deployment of Drupal applications to remote servers hosted on Okitup using Ansible. It automates the setup and configuration process, ensuring a smooth deployment workflow.
<br>
<br>

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Ansible installed on your local machine. Follow the instructions. [Ansible-drupal](https://intranet.tothomweb.com/node/342)
- Ansistrano deploy installed on your local machine. Follow the instructions. [Ansistrano-deploy](https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy)
- Basic understanding of Drupal project structure and deployment processes.

<br>
<br>

## Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) and [Ansistrano Deploy](https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy), as a template. Also, we used the [opdavies role](https://github.com/opdavies/ansible-role-drupal-settings)

<br>
<br>

## Usage

1. **Download installer:**

   - Run this command in your Drupal root in order to download the bash file.
     `mkdir -p ~/.bin && curl -o ~/.bin/ansible-installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webfer/ansible-drupal/main/scripts/ansible-installer.sh && source ~/.bin/ansible-installer.sh && autorun`
     This file contains custom code snippets to install this application into your Drupal project.

2. **Install this application in your Drupal root:**

   - Run the following command to install Ansible within your Drupal project:
     `ansible-install`

   **Fantastic!** You have successfully cloned the configuration, along with the necessary Ansible files, onto your local machine for deployment.

## Setting up Ansible with real project and remote server data.

To provide Ansible with the actual server data. Follow these steps:

Within your project, locate the following directories and files:

1. **Tools / Ansible**

   - The _Tools > Ansible_ is the root directory inside of your Drupal project.

2. **provision_vault.yml**

   - The _provision_vault.yml_ file contains all variables for your connection between the local machine to the remote server.

3. **ansible.cf**

   - The _ansible.cf_ file contains additional configuration to make Ansible work as expected.

4. **vault_pass.txt**
   - The _vault_pass.txt_ file contains the pass to encrypt/decrypt the provision_vault.yml file.

## Initial deployment

These are the allowed options:

**--stage** Deploys the site to a STAGE environment using a basic Auth, also, using an .htpasswd file.

**--live** Deploys the site to a LIVE environment

**--install** Deploys the site for the first time, including a complete database import.

**--update** Deploys the changes made since the last deployment, and updates the database with a configuration import.

**--with-assets** (Optional) Deploys and synchronizes the with-assets from the local machine to the remote server. This option ensures that files deleted locally are also deleted on the remote server.
<br>
For initial deployment in the staging environment without assets, run this command in your terminal:
`ansible-deploy --stage --install`
The above command will deploy without including the assets folder.
<br>
For initial deployment in the staging environment with assets, run this command in your terminal:
`ansible-deploy --stage --install --with-assets`
The above command will deploy including the assets folder.

## Regular deployment

For regular deployment, run in your terminal this command:
`ansible-deploy --stage --update `
